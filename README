rmlint is a command line tool to remove various sort of unused files form a Unix filesystem, especially duplicate files.
It comes without any extra depencies, and is build to handle even large filesystems pretty fast.  
It is written in pure ANSI C, and comes with as size of 36KB. 

DISCLAIMER: 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THIS SOFTWARE WON'T KILL YOUR FILES, NOR THAT IT KILLS YOUR KITTEN, BURNS YOUR HOUSE, OR WHATSOEVER. 
IT WAS written carefully and in the hope it'll will be useful for some messy users. 

INSTALL: 
--------
The usual mantra: 

make -j 4 
sudo make install 

COMPARASION TO OTHER TOOLS: 
--------------------------
(this list could get very, very long..) 

compared to... 
	..fdupes / duff: 
		+ LOTS faster	
		+ more options 
		+ finds also bad links 
		+ logging

	..rdfind: 
		+ Live output of finds
		+ mostly as fast, or faster
		+ little less buggy ;-) 
		- handles large folders with lots of files not as good.
		
	..fslint: 
		+ Faster / more options 
		- finds no stripped binaries, old tmpdata, etc. (ToDo?) 
		
	..[other cons] 
		- does not look into archives (things like those could be performed by some bash script easier)

Benchmark was on a EeePc 1015HP ;-) 
On a recent quadcoremachine things will get lot's faster.

HELP: 
------------
Use: 
- 'rmlint -h'
- 'man rmlint' 


FEATURES:
--------
- Can be aborted at any time. Will display all finds then. (or abort immediately if user presses CTRL-C once more) 
- Fast. (Really! :)) 
- Regex filter. 
- Colorful! :-) (can be compiled without colors support if you like to) 
- Can handle huge amount of files. 
- Handles the files the way you want: 
   + replace double file by a symboliclink, (-m link)  
   + Removes the file without asking you. (-m noask) 
   + Simply list all files without doing anything dangerous. (-m list) 
   + It executes a user specified commando for each file (-m cmd) 
   + It asks you for each file what you want. (-m ask)
- Minimum of I/O, focuses on CPU usage. 
- It has some basic "API" (Well, let's just say you can exec it from your program :-)) 
- Writes a log of all found files (./rmlint.sh or name by --output) or outputs a ready to use script  


HOW DOES THIS THING WORK (ALGORITHM): 
-------------------------------
rmlint tries to reduce Input/Output to a minimum and focues on CPU Usage.
Therefore it goes recursively through all directories and pushes all files back to a doubly linked list. 
This list is now split in several groups: Every size get's it's own group, and groups with only one element are dropped.
Empty files and bad links are handled on this way too. (they build a group with a size of 0 ;))  
Now every group is given to a sheduler which filters each group by portions of the file, and builds md5sum on each survivor.
Note that several groups may get processed in parallel!  A log of all files is written to a file called 'rmlint.sh' (name changeable with '--output'). 
Additionally it may handle finds by removeing them, linking them to the original or executing some shellcommand on them. 



A NOTE ABOUT FALSE POSITIVES: 
-----------------------------
False Positves are actuallly possible, but very unlikely. 
A so-called collision has about a probability (under best conditions) of 1/(255^16) + 
They would need to have the same size to be marked as duplicate.  
=> Very unlikely, but possible.

But isn't there a solution? Yes, there is. It's the "--paranoid/-p" option. It does a 
true byte-by-byte comparasion of each(!) file. Be warned. It's incredibly slow. 


FAQ: 
----
Q: The "-m list" output is crap! I want more information! 
A: You can use the command mode to use to run 'ls' on the files: 
   Example: time ./rmlint . -m cmd -c "ls -lasi '%s'" -C "ls '%s'" -v 1
   Where -c executes "ls -lasi" on the found duplicate, -C on the original. 
     
Q: I want only the found files to be displayed! Like fdupes does! 
A: "-v 1" is your friend.
