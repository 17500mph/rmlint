----------
+ Added '//' at end of line in log (for names that contain '\n' this may be a bit easier)
+ -cC now works with '<dupl>' and '<orig>' as replacement pattern instead of '%s' /which makes ln -s <orig> <dupl> possible'

----------
+ Fixed crash that occured when having '%' in filenames (shame-on-me) (thanks Micheal)
+ Fixed (critical) issue that flagged files with the same size, in the same group as duplicates (thanks Micheal)
+ Fixed issue with the removeable-size printed (thanks Micheal)
+ Segfault with -B (d'oh)
