2.1.0 Malnourished Molly
------------------------

Notable user changes since 2.0.0:

Bugfixes:

    - performance regression: When having many pairs of duplicates,
      the core got slower very fast due to linear lookups. Fixed.
    - performance regression: No SSDs were detected due to two bugs.
    - commandline aborts also on non-fatal option misuses.
    - Some statistic counts were updated wrong sometimes. 
    - Fixes in treemerge to respect directories tagges as originals.
    - Ignore "evil" fs types like bindfs, nullfs completely.
    - Fix race in file tree traversal.
    - various smaller bugfixes.

Features:

    - --partial-hidden does only see hidden files in duplicate directories.
    - --cache/--write-unfinished can be used to speedup re-runs drastically.
    - Checksums can be stored in the xattr of files with --xattr-read/write/clear.
    - New progressbar output inspired by journalctl --verfiy.
    - Support replacing files by a reflink if the filesystem supports it.

Misc:

    - Defaut digest is now sha1 instead of spooky.
    - updated .pot template with help strings.
    - updated german translation accordingly.
    - -T supports arguments like df,dd properly now.
    - New --help text that shows a short reference only.
